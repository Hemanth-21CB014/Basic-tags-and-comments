        <p>Snapdragon is a brand of mobile system-on-chips (SoCs) developed by Qualcomm, which are used in many popular smartphones. The latest Snapdragon SoC for mobiles is the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1.
            The Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 is built on a 4nm process and features an octa-core CPU with a tri-cluster architecture. It consists of four Cortex-X2 high-performance cores running at up to 3.2 GHz, three Cortex-A710 cores running at up to 2.7 GHz, and one Cortex-A510 efficiency core running at up to 1.8 GHz. This allows for smooth multitasking, faster app load times, and improved overall performance.
            The SoC also includes an Adreno 730 GPU, which provides a 30% improvement in graphics performance compared to the previous generation. It supports up to 8K display resolution and HDR10+.
            The Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 also includes a Snapdragon X65 5G modem, which supports both sub-6GHz and mmWave 5G bands. It also supports Wi-Fi 6E and Bluetooth 5.2, as well as dual-SIM 5G connectivity.
            The SoC is designed to offer advanced camera capabilities, including support for up to 200-megapixel cameras and simultaneous triple-camera streams. It also includes a sixth-generation Qualcomm AI Engine, which offers up to 32 TOPS (trillion operations per second) of AI performance.
            Overall, the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 is an advanced mobile SoC that provides powerful performance, advanced connectivity, and improved camera capabilities. It is expected to be used in many high-end smartphones in the coming year.</p>
